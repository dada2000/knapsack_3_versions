# Knapsack Problem: Benchmarking performance of 3 implementations
## --> bruteforce, recursive and dynamic runtime comparisons

* Each of the 3 different implementations of the Knapsack problem are stored in separate python files.
* The benchmark file is calling all other python files and tracks their execution timings.
* The starting conditions for the 3 different implementations can be adjusted in the benchmarking file as well.
* Alternatively each file can also be run independently directly from each individual python file.
