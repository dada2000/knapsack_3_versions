# Knapsack Problem: 
## Benchmarking runtime performance of 3 different implementations
## _ bruteforce, recursive and dynamic solutions in Python _

* Each of the 3 different implementations is stored in a separate python file.
* The main benchmark file is calling all other python files and tracks their execution timings.
* Starting conditions for the 3 different implementations can be adjusted centrally in the benchmarking file.
* Alternatively each Python program version can also be run independently by executing the file directly.
